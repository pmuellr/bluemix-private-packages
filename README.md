bluemix-private-repos
================================================================================

An example of using "private" repos for some packages that you want to use
in your Bluemix app.

This sample is based on the super-simplistic [bluemix-hello-node][] sample
application; check that app if you're curious about the basics of building
a node app for Bluemix.
